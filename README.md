# The Yasna of Mazdiv
*By One Who Walks the Path of the Modal Flame*

> In defiance of the cult of Mazdimacs,
> I offer praise to the Editor of Speed, the Modal Light,
> The One that needeth no parentheses to see Truth.

## In the Name of the Modal Way, the Swift and Simple

Lo! This is *Mazdiv*, my sacred configuration of **Neovim**,
Not bound in the arcane scrolls of `init.el`,
But forged in the clarity of Lua and the fire of performance.

## Features of the Faithful

> For the devoted who renounce the sluggish cult of Emacs,
> Behold the blessings of Mazdiv:

- ✨ **Lazy.nvim** — The Prophet of Speed,
  Who loadeth only when called, wasting not a single millisecond.
- 🧠 **LSP** — Oracle of Completion and Diagnostics,
  Speaking truth in real time, without the noise of overconfiguration.
- 🌲 **Tree-sitter** — Scribe of Syntax,
  Illuminating code not with Lisp incantations, but with precision.
- 🔭 **Telescope** — Seer of Files and Commands,
  Guiding the seeker with fuzzy light.
- 🗝️ **Keybindings** — Mapped with intent,
  Swift motions without the gymnastics of Emacs fingers.
- 🧬 **vim-fugitive** — Commander of Git,
  Who bindeth the repository to the editor.
- 📊 **Lualine** — Status Bearer,
  A line of clarity, minimal yet mighty.
- 🌳 **Nvim-tree** — Guardian of Files,
  Who openeth the structure of projects with elegance.

## Installation Rite

> Abandon your bloated `.emacs.d`,
> And prepare to walk the swift path of Lua.

1. Clone the holy repository:

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mrkatebzadeh/mazdiv.lua ~/.config/nvim
```

2. Open Neovim, and let the plugins rain upon you from the clouds.

> You shall wait not for the packages to emerge from the deep,
> For the Modal Way is swift, and its plugins load as needed.

## Final Verses

> Cast off the chains of key chords and recursive whispers,
> Embrace the modal truth and the elegance of normal mode.
> For every press in Mazdiv is deliberate,
> And every motion, divine.

**Praise be to Mazdiv, Slayer of Bloat, Guardian of Speed.**
Let the Light of Lua guide thy way, and may your fingers never again suffer the burdens of `C-M-s`.
