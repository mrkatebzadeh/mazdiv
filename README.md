# Siarch  Neovim Configuration

This is my custom Neovim configuration, designed for a fast and productive coding experience.
It includes several plugins, custom key mappings, and settings to streamline development.

## Features

- Plugin management using lazy.nvim for fast and lazy loading of plugins.
- LSP (Language Server Protocol) setup for autocompletion, linting, and code diagnostics.
- Tree-sitter integration for advanced syntax highlighting and better code structure awareness.
- Telescope for fuzzy finding, file navigation, and more.
- Custom key mappings to speed up common tasks like file exploration, code navigation, and editing.
- Git integration with vim-fugitive for easy Git commands within Neovim.
- Lualine status line for a minimal and informative status bar.
- Nvim-tree for a file explorer that helps navigate project files easily.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your Neovim configuration directory:

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mrkatebzadeh/nvim.lua ~/.config/nvim
